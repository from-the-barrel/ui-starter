            In 1928, José Carlos Mariátegui wrote a book. The book was titled:{" "}
            <i>Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality.</i> Mariáteguistas
            have puzzled over Peruvian reality ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            In either 1968 or 1969, Abimael Guzmán, chairman of the Shining
            Path, gave a lecture at the Universidad Nacional de San Cristóbal de
            Huamanga in Ayachucho. The lecture was titled:{" "}
            <i>To Understand Mariátegui</i>.
          </p>
          <p>Guzmán says:</p>
          <p>
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              “There is not in all of Latin America another Marxist-Leninist
              comparable to him in any way; truly José Carlos Mariátegui is a
              summit of Latin-American Marxism thought and a greater summit as
              time goes on.”
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, shane (mariáte)greene, punk anthropologist, wrote a book
            published by Duke University Press. The book was titled:{" "}
            <i>
              punk and revolution: 7 more interpretations of peruvian reality
            </i>
            .
          </p>
          <p>(mariáte)greene says:</p>
          <p>"Thanks go to the ghost of Mariátegui for putting up with me."</p>
          <p>
            So: I want to take this space to think about ghosts. The ghost of
            Mariátegui, still bound to his wheelchair, still righteous and
            angry, still interpreting Peruvian reality.
          </p>

            Let it be known that I will respect the page. By that I mean that
            the words that I write and the images that I present will never
            exceed the width and height of the one single screen. This is a
            codex. This is not a scroll. But let it also be known this may not
            hold true for every single device upon which this might be read. The
            page will be respected, but the page is bound by the material on
            which it is written. Let us think about metal, because this will be
            a project in metal. My metal is a 2022 M2 MacBook Air. My metal has
            a 13.6-inch display, 2560 by 1664 pixels. This project is a tightly
            bound codex in this metal, but may be a loose unfurling scroll in
            other metals. Remember that text itself has a geography.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let it be said that this project will attempt to take seriously the
            Sendero Luminoso, known in English as the Shining Path. I will not
            valorize them, but I am not willing to dismiss them as simple
            fanatics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let it be acknowledged that this is an unfortunate project of the
            petit bourgeois intellectual. By that, I am referencing what Guzmán
            has to say about technology:
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={{ paddingLeft: 50, flex: 1 }}>
          <p>
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              "Scientific and technological developments are products of the
              transformative action of the proletariat and the people. But the
              financial oligarchy, the grand bourgeois, imperialism appropriate
              them. They are their private property, of the monopolies and
              instruments of exploitation. In the shadow of this has developed a
              layer of scum of technocrats, who craftily try, making noises
              aimed at the working class, and especially at petit bourgeois
              intellectuals, to substitute a false revolution, with a different
              path, without the class struggle. However, only with real
              revolution can science and technology fulfill their potential.
              Because only with revolution will their full productivity be
              realized, and their benefits reach the workers and the poor."
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This project will have all the markings of my positionality. This
            project will liberate the image. This project will free the image
            specifically "under the sign of hallucination and madness." This
            project is a product of technology. This project will be entirely
            open source. This project will use its status of being open source
            to participate in a larger project of wresting the locus of
            technological power away from{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              "the finanical oligarchy, the grand bourgeois, imperialism."{" "}
            </span>{" "}
            This project will try. This project will talk about revolution. This
            project is about revolution but not of it, per Guzmán. This project
            will interpret Peruvian reality, if only the thinnest slice of it,
            seen through the tiniest pinhole.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will read the Shining Path's material. I will read what Mariátegui
            and his interlocutors have to say. I will gather and generate a
            series of provocative images. I will hypnotize myself by means of
            these images. I will engage in automatic writing. This will be the
            combined cybernetic dream of human and metal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why this method? Because this invokes the method of surrealism,
            which Mariátegui himself was fascinated by, which Suzanne Césaire
            said was not an ideology but rather a "permanent readiness for the
            Marvelous." It embraces the strange. This is certainly a strange
            project. The image will be annihilated, transformed, and
            reconstituted. I cannot say it better than Césaire already did in
            1941:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Surrealism nourishes an impatient strength within us, endlessly
            reinforcing the massive army of refusals. [...] Our surrealism will
            enable us to finally transcend the sordid dichotomies of the present
            [...] Colonial idiocy will be purified in the welder's blue flame.
            We shall recover our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our
            unprecedented communions."
          </p>
          <p>Once more: this project will be a project in metal.</p>
