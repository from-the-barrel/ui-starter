            Here, I will return to China. I will betray my personal interest in
            the project of the Shining Path, which is rooted in transpacific
            interests. The Shining Path is a Maoist project, which makes it in
            some ways a project in diasporic ideology. As I regard myself also
            in the condition of the Chinese diaspora, I feel an acute affinity
            for them.

            In 1965, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Abimael Guzmán went
            to China. He never met Mao, was only able to see him from a
            distance. But he felt deep in his bones the{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              “deep affection of the people for a great Leader, an extraordinary
              Marxist, a pinnacle of Marxism.”

          <p>Let's have an anecdote.</p>
          <p>
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              "Well, if you'd like an anecdote, here's one. When we were
              finishing the course on explosives, they told us that anything can
              explode. So, at the end of the course, we picked up a pen and it
              blew up, and when we took a seat it blew up, too. It was a kind of
              general fireworks display. These were perfectly calculated
              examples to show us that anything could be blown up if you figured
              out how to do it. We constantly asked, "How do you do this? How do
              you do that?" They would tell us, don't worry, don't worry, you've
              already learned enough. Remember what the masses can do, they have
              inexhaustible ingenuity, what we've taught you the masses will do
              and will teach you all over again."
            </span>

          <p>Everything can and must explode.</p>
          <p>
            Maoism in Peru was tempered by Guzmán’s reading of Mariátegui,
            domesticated to the Peruvian context. Under the Shining Path’s
            Maoist thought, the highland campesino was the revolutionary
            protagonist. This radical subject had an invicible force of
            imagination, able to hold both a violent present and a kinder future
            in stereoscopy. They could close history into a loop.

            Here is a story from China that Guzmán is unlikely to have written
            about, but I hope he has dreamed about.

            昔者莊周夢為胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也，自喻適志與。不知周也。俄然覺，則蘧蘧然周也。不知周之夢為蝴蝶與，蝴蝶之夢為周與。周與蝴蝶，則必有分矣。此之謂物化。
            —A passage about Zhuang Zhou, a Daoist philosopher. Translation
            courtesy of my parents, whose version of this I have no choice but
            to trust, on account of my illiteracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Once upon a time, there is a person named Zhuang Zhou dreamed
            himself becomes a butterfly, a very vivid butterfly, in the dream,
            he completely forgot he was Zhuang Zhou. Then he suddenly woke up,
            he realized he is still Zh[u]ang Zhou. Nobody knows Zhuang Zhou
            becomes butterfly in his dream, or butterfly becomes Zhuang Zhou in
            its dream. Zhuang Zhou and Butterfly are definitely different, but
            they could be “Reification.”
          </p>
          <p>One more story about Zhuang Zhou, also known as Zhuangzi.</p>
          <p>
            Once, Zhuangzi and Huizi were standing on a bridge above the Hao
            River. Zhuangzi remarked: The fish are swimming so freely in the
            waves. This is the joy of fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Huizi replies: You are not a fish. How do you know that the fish are
            happy? To which Zhuangzi replies: You are not me. How can you know
            that I do not know they are happy?
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not you, therefore I cannot know. But likewise you are not a
            fish, therefore you cannot know their joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us go back to the beginning. You asked, "How do you know the
            fish are happy?" But when you asked this you already knew I knew it.
            I knew it here on the Hao.
