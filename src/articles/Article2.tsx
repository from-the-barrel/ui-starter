            Let me take a page out of Mariátegui's book and leave you with an
            epigraph from a long dead German. Mariátegui's German of choice was
            Nietzsche.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wanted to write "as Nietzsche would have wished, for he did not
            love authors who strained after the intentional, deliberate
            production of a book, but rather those whose thoughts formed a book
            spontaneously and without premeditation."
          </p>
          <p>
            This statement of intent has a surprising surrealist turn. The
            surrealist writers in the tradition of Breton (whose work Mariátegui
            would publish in Amauta) worked quickly, disgorging an
            uncontrollable stream of words from their minds. Mariátegui too
            wrote with his blood. That is to say: his life and his work were one
            cybernetic organism.
          </p>
          <p>My German of choice is Rilke, who is actually Austrian.</p>

          <b>PORTRAIT OF MY FATHER AS A YOUNG MAN</b> <br></br>
          Dream in the eyes. The brow as in relation<br></br>
          with something distant. Mouth with more than the norm <br></br>Of
          youth, unsmilingly diffused temptation, <br></br>and, placed before
          the corded decoration<br></br> of the slim, gentlemanly uniform,
          <br></br> the sabre-hilt and those two hands, that stay<br></br>{" "}
          quiescent, – with no passionate intent.<br></br> And hardly to be seen
          now: as if they<br></br> were first to vanish, grasping the unscanned.
          <br></br>
          And all the rest in self-envelopment<br></br> and quenched as if we
          didn’t understand<br></br> and deeply, from its very depth, opaque.
          <br></br>
          You swiftly fading daguerreotype I take<br></br> in my more gradually
          fading hand.
