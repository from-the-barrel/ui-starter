            Let us compromise the image. By that I mean we must recognize that
            the image is not one thing, but rather a collection (or more
            accurately a summation) of waves, or frequencies. Signal processing
            theory tells us this. We perceive an image as a whole object only as
            a heuristic. What we are seeing is the additive product of thousands
            of wave functions. The Fourier transformation proves this. We can
            decompose an image into a dozen million bases, each of which looks
            like a uniform zebra-striped pattern. Then we can add them all
            together, and create an image.

            Look to the right. The first basis image plus the second produces
            the third. Add together a few hundred thousand of these and we might
            to begin to see something that approaches the appearance of
            Mari√°tegui.

            Freud thought that technology only solved problems that technology
            had itself caused. This may be true. What is the point of signal
            processing theory, of the Fourier transformation, if you do not
            violently capture the image in the first place? Reality does not
            have basis images. The rock is a rock. The tree is a tree. It is
            only our images of them that are composed of bases. If you did not
            appropriate their images for your feeble metal and its flickering
            screen, or, more primitively, the light-sensitive organs in the eye,
            and instead leave it in nature, then there would be no bases. You
            cannot dissect the image until you have placed it on your dissecting
            table, that is, the hard drive.

            A reminder that this is a project in first annihilating the image.
