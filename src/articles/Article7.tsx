            I want to think about dogs. On December 26, 1980, residents of
            Ayacucho, Peru woke up to find dead dogs strung up and hung from
            lamp posts. Their corpses were wrapped with signs that read “Deng
            Xiaoping son of a bitch” (Teng Hsiao-Ping hijo de perra), and rumors
            began to circulate that explosives were hidden among the dogs{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>(anything can explode)</span>.
          </p>

            Journalist Santiago Roncagliolo recalls the disorienting effect of
            the moment, which occurred during his childhood: “I saw the
            photograph [of the dogs] in a magazine that my father had brought
            home. Naturally I did not know who Deng Xiao Ping was, and [...] I
            quickly forgot the whole thing, but a few years later, when my
            father announced with a smile that we were returning to Perú, I
            remembered the dogs and said that I did not want to go back there.”

            The act was as spectacular as it was illegible. Even still, a deep
            impression in the mind.

            Guzmán and the Shining Path were not just Maoists in name. All
            revionists dogs must die. Those who claim the legacy of Mao do not
            faithfully trace his footsteps must explode.

            They prized the image. On Christmas and New Year's, they would cut
            power to Lima by dynamiting transmission towers. Always at midnight.
            On these silent and darkened nights, they would cause explosions in
            the hills around the city. Sometimes, they would start fires in the
            shape of a hammer and sickle in the hills. In the blackened
            cityscape, this would be the only light in the night.
