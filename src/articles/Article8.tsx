            Let us think about tunnels and mines and the earth because I want to
            trace metal to its roots. Where was this metal sourced? Where do our
            machines come from? It may have been from a mine in Peru. Gold is
            used in pins, relays, connectors, charging coils, cameras, and PCB
            circuits. Gold is critical, and Peru is the second-largest exporter
            of gold in Latin America.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us experience the building of this metal in reverse. A delivery
            truck speeds backwards up the I-495. A shipping container drifts,
            its pilots blind to its destination, backwards across the ocean. In
            a cold and sterile facility in Yan’an, a woman with a tiny
            screwdriver takes the chassis off the laptop. She passes it to the
            woman to her left, who is also holding a tiny screwdriver, and who
            deftly dismantles the motherboard. A million little gold components
            melt and reconstitute into neatly stacked bars. They arrive in Peru
            in a processing facility, where they are turned back into tons and
            tons of earth. Hundreds of trucks deliver this earth back to the
            Yanacocha gold mine, this open-pit mine, this enormous and deep scar
            in the land. Miraculously, the earth from the trucks is shoveled out
            back into the land. Dynamite unexplodes. The earth heals. Today is a
            rainy day. Reverse-raindrops drip upwards to heaven.

            All throughout the Shining Path’s existence, the enganche system was
            being covertly employed. This was a system of indentured labor,
            wherein largely indigenous rural peasants were paid a lump sum
            upfront, which they would then pay off as a debt (with skyrocketing
            interest) with back-breaking work in the mines. Work was dangerous,
            and somehow workers would end their indentured period with even more
            debt than when they started.

            This page, and two others, do not contain an image. But in reality,
            every page in this project contains an image. The text and the
            layout of the page itself is an image. Everything displayed on your
            screen is an image. Your metal works solely in images.

            That the digital is not physical is a myth. It requires an immense
            amount of infrastructure. Trillions of transistors, the basic
            computing unit of this metal, are manufactured every second. Silicon
            wafers are battered with light to trace a pattern into their
            surface. Photolithography. We used to dip them into acid to etch
            them, but now mostly we bombard them with superheated gasses.
          </p>
          <p>An immense violence was levied to make this metal.</p>
          <p>
            There is a tendency to view the digital image as an ephemeral thing.
            We forget that our machines, our metal, have viscera. They have
            organs. Our images were paid for in someone else’s blood.
