            Here is José Carlos Mariátegui. In 1924, a malignant tumor in his
            left thigh required the amputation of the limb. For several days
            after the operation, he thought that his leg was simply asleep. Two
            years later in 1926, he founded the magazine Amauta to publish the
            thoughts of a new radiant generation of Peruvian thinkers. Two years
            later in 1928, he founded the Socialist Party of Peru, which would
            later become the Communist Party of Peru, a splinter group of which
            would later become the Shining Path. Two years later in 1930, he was
            dead. Here is the ghost that will guide us.
          </p>
          <p>
            About this photograph, he said: "Es una fotografía tomada en uno de
            los nuevos parques de Lima, próximos a mi casa, por el pintor
            argentino José Malanca, que a su paso por esta se hizo excelente
            amigo mío."
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality</i>, Mariátegui
            casts aside metaphysics. Mariátegui was interested in material. Said
            another way: he was interested in metal. Problems of law, culture,
            society, administration, ethics, education, and literature could not
            be studied simply as such. They proceeded from reality. Which is to
            say: the land.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Shining Path, the most ardently Mariáteguista solution is
            then very simple.{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
              “The problem of the Peruvian peasant is the problem of the land,
              and the problem of the land is summarized by how to conquer that
              land,"
            </span>{" "}
            says Guzmán.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will think about Mariátegui and we will think about the Shining,
            and other, Path(s). We will learn to dream while still awake. We
            will learn the beauty of the chance encounter of a sewing machine
            and an umbrella on the dissecting table.
          </p>

            Let us look towards dreams and dream of another future, and another
            past. Let us commit ourselves to a surrealism that is commited to
            the visceral. Let us keep our minds swimming in invisible ether, but
            our feet on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            In literature, realism alienated us from reality. Realist experience
            has simply shown us that we can only encounter reality through the
            path of fantasy. Mariátegui said this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, a word of caution, again from the master of interpreting
            reality:
          </p>
          <p>
            "But fiction is not free. More than unveil for us the marvelous (lo
            maravilloso), it seems destined to reveal the real to us. When
            fantasy does not bring us closer to reality, it does not amount to
            much. Philosophers draw on false concepts to arrive at the truth.
            Men of letters use fiction for the same purpose. Fantasy only has
            value when it creates something real. This is its limitation. This
            is its drama."
